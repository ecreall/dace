DaCE data-centric workflow engine
=================================

Dace is a data-centric workflow engine. It enables the definition and execution of complex processes and the definition of objects of collaboration. In DaCE the rights management is based on the definition of roles.

It is licensed under a `AGPLv3+ license <http://fsf.org/>`_.

Here is one of the simplest DaCE process you can make:

.. literalinclude:: narr/helloworld.py
